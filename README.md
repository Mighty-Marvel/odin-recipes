This project is part of my journey through The Odin Project's curriculum. I am building a basic recipe website using HTML to practice and demonstrate my HTML skills. The website will consist of an index page with links to various recipes. The primary focus here is on content and structure, and I plan to revisit the project in the future to enhance its design and user experience with CSS.

Throughout this project, I'll be demonstrating my ability to create HTML files, link them together, organize content using headings, paragraphs, and lists, and understand the basics of version control with Git and GitHub. This project is the starting point for my journey toward improving the visual appeal and interactivity of the recipe website with CSS and JavaScript. I look forward to honing my HTML skills and building a solid foundation for my web development journey.
