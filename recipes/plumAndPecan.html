    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt (such as FageÂ® 2%)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups diced pitted plums</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>
    

        <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup standard muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, ginger, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk yogurt, orange juice, eggs, butter, and vanilla until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of dry ingredients; pour yogurt mixture into well and stir just until batter is combined. Gently fold in plums and pecans. Evenly spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
